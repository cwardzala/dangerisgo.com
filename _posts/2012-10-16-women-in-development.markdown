I have worked closely with two women developers in my career, and I must say they taught me so much I couldn't even begin to explain.<!-- more -->

I was fortunate to have a great mentor when I was first cutting my teeth at a big agency and yes it was a woman. She helped me get out of a pretty bad rut and begin to spread my wings and become the developer I am today. She taught me not only how to be a better developer but how to work with others better and how to step back and look at projects and development from a whole new light.

The women I have been lucky enough to work with have brought something to development far beyond technical knowledge, they bring a level of compassion and understanding that I have never seen in any other developer man or woman.

I want to say thank you to all women developers for undoubtedly making your male counterparts better by association, you are all awesome and need to be recognized for that.
