So this is my new site, it was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Sekeleton](http://getskeleton.com). I have decided not to stray too far from the base Skeleton styles because they are nice and simple. I want this site to be about me sharing information and not about how flashy it looks. I am planning to add some addtional sections to this site once I have them ready for prime time but for now its just the basics.
